			<h3>C</h3>
				<h4>Example</h4>
				<i>(Taken from LibSimpleC)</i>
				<pre>
					<code>
int atoi(const char* src) {
	size_t i = 0;
	int ret = 0;
	bool inNumber = false;
	bool isNegative = false;
	for(; src[i] != 0; i++) {
		/*before the number is found in the string*/
		if (inNumber == false) {
			/*check if there is a leading - sign*/
			if (src[i] == '-') {
				inNumber = true;
				isNegative = true;
			}
			/*if not, check if the leading digit has been found*/
			else if (src[i] >= '0' && src[i] <= '9') {
				inNumber = true;
				ret = addToNumber(ret, src[i]);
			}
		}
		/*inside the number, check if the current char is still a digit*/
		else if (src[i] >= '0' && src[i] <= '9'){
			ret = addToNumber(ret, src[i]);
		}
		/*if the current char is not a digit, the number is over*/
		else {
			break;
		}
	}
	if (isNegative) {
		return ret*-1;
	}
	return ret;

			<h4>Comments</h4>
			<p>
				I always use the "/**/" comment format, even for single-line comments. I believe this encourages me to put comments
				on their own lines. In turn, I think this leads to more meaningful content as opposed to quick comments at the end
				of a line. It should be noted that I'm a bit lazy and don't use the traditional leading asterisks like I should. This
				is for consistency among the other languages that I write in that don't use that convention.
			</p>
			<h4>Indentation and bracket placement</h4>
			<p>
				I always use hard tabs when possible in any language. I know there exists a lot of controversey on this regard, and
				I don't have a zealous opinion on this. On the other hand, hard tabs are easier to navigate when the text editor
				you're using doesn't know how to detect soft tabs and skip them automatically. Also, I have yet to meet a language
				that honestly refuses them, though I know M4 refuses to parse soft tabs.
			</p>
			<p>
				I put my opening brackets on the same line as the expression they belong to. Some people like it the other way. That's
				fine, but this way is easier for me to read. It allows me to look straight up from the respective closing bracket and
				see the exact statement it belongs to rather than having to skip up an extra line.
			</p>
			<h4>Naming Stuff</h4>
			<p>
				As per C tradition, I name public-facing things underscore-deliminated style. Private things such as locals and helper
				functions are camelCased. This isn't very C-like, but I like it. It makes it easier for me to tell when something is
				intended to be global or not.
			</p>
			<h4>Functions and other syntax</h4>
			<p>
				I always omit the space between the function name and the argument list in any language that supports it. I have no
				reasoning to back this up other than it saves my thumb a trip to the space bar. This is pretty much the only place I
				omit whitespace. Argument lists either in declarations or calls are always space-separated. I think it looks a lot
				cleaner.
			</p>
			<p>
				Return is not a function. I don't treat as so (though I did when I first learned C++). sizeof is also not a function,
				though I'm <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/11/103">with Linus on this one</a>. It makes more sense to treat it
				as one.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<h3>C++</h3>
			<p>
				I use the same styling rules as C for the most part. I'll update this section once I get back into a C++ project again.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<h3>Python</h3>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> says that I should use 4-space tabs. It says a lot of
				other things, too. A lot of those I don't care to read or just ignore. Like the recommendation to use underscore-
				deliminated variable names. I like camelCase too much for that. It looks better.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<h3>JavaScript</h3>
			<h4>Example</h4>
			<i>(From my fork of LinterGCC)</i>
			<pre>
				<code>
buildCommand: function(activeEditor, file) {
  if (atom.config.get("linter-gcc.gccDebug")) {
    console.log("linter-gcc config: " + JSON.stringify(settings));
  }
  let command = this.getCommandFromCMake(file, activeEditor, settings);
  if (!command) {
    /*buildCommandFromSettings returns a complete object*/
    return this.buildCommandFromSettings(file, activeEditor, settings);
  }
  /*Split the binary name from before the first space and
    the args from behind it*/
  let binary = command.substring(0, command.indexOf(" "));
  let args = command.substring(command.indexOf(" ")+1, command.length);
  args = this.fixFlags(args);
  return {binary: this.findBinary(binary), args: args};
},
				</code>
			</pre>
			<p>
				I try to write JavaScript like I write C/C++ as much as possible. The comment and indentation styles I use are mostly
				the same. I like the new ES6 variable statements (let and const). They make scoping a lot easier to track. On the
				other hand, the new short function statements (&lt;varname&gt; =&gt;...) aren't very readible and I avoid using them.
			</p>

			<h3>HTML</h3>
			<h4>Example</h4>
			<i>(From the header of this page)</i>
			<pre>
				<code>
&lt;div id="bar-left"&gt;
	&lt;h1 id="name"&gt;
		Zane J&lt;br/&gt;
		Cersovsky
	&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;a href="/"&gt;Main Page&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;a href="https://github.com/zjcers/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
			&lt;a href="/files/resume.pdf"&gt;Resume&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
				</code>
			</pre>
			<p>
				My only big style rules for HTML are to always use tabs to show how many tags a given position is inside and to be as
				semantic as possible. HTML has a lot of special tags that mean special things. Use them. Like all other languages,
				I like to keep it legible and cut my line length down to where my editor usually ends (around character 125).
