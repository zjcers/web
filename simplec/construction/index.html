			<h1>Constructing a stdlib in C</h1>
			<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
			<p>
			Coming into this, you should know basic programming, but being a wizard 
			of object-oriented design or dreaming in pure Haskell is of no need. 
			This is C: "C doesn't do that". 
			What you should you have is a [un]healthy desire to peer behind the 
			curtain and see what the rest of your system (assuming you are running 
			Linux or another Unix-like). 
			</p>
			<p>
			On the other side, if you're already proficient in C and/or have a 
			good grasp on the magic that goes on to make your programs work, 
			this is not for you. Feel free to read on and find any mistakes I 
			have made. Suggestions are definitely welcome (open an issue on my 
			github "web" repo).
			</p> 
			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>
			So why would you want to build such a thing? It's certainly not a 
			practical endeavor. I'd never trust Project Paxico with anything 
			important. The point is, as mentioned above, to learn.
			</p>
			<p>
			And what can you learn from this? First off, if you're unfamiliar with 
			C, this document has a crash course in the basics and little notes and 
			gotchas sprinkled throughout. That was what I intended to learn when I 
			started writing my stdlib. There's also a lot of "peering behind the 
			curtain" to see how common mechanisms, such as memory allocation and 
			program start up, work.
			</p>
			<p>
			As a last note before this tutorial begins in earnest, this is not a 
			great document from a theoretical perspective. C is not the end-all of 
			languages, and a Unix-like stdlib is most definitely not the best 
			solution out there. However, these are common things in practice and 
			this document is meant to pragmatic, not perfect.
