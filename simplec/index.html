			<h1>Project Paxico LibC</h1>
			<i style="text-align: center;">A simple C standard library that I'm writing to learn about C</i>
			<h2>Origins</h2>
			<p>
				When I started this project, I was midway through EECS 268 (Programming II). I really enjoyed the freedom in the class, as far as
				structure and implementation were concerned. I began to use pattern rules in my Makefiles and convenience libraries built from
				subdirectories to structure my projects for the class. Being an avid tinkerer, I had to know how more of the code I was writing
				worked. One thing led to another and I wrote a simple malloc() and free(). My original intention was to surprise my TA by turning
				in a lab assignment that had no external dependencies, but this was a pipe dream. Doubly so since the class was in C++ and the
				C++ start up code does some interesting things when it initializes constructors and destructors. Stuff that my Programming II
				mind could only begin to comprehend.
			</p>
			<h2>Philosophy</h2>
			<p>
				I enjoy knowing how things work. Sometimes, to learn how something works, you just have to sit down and build one. That is
				difficult with this project since at the beginning of the project, I barely knew C++, let alone the added intricacies of working
				with freestanding C. On the other, that's just another opportunity to learn some fun stuff.
			</p>
			<h2>Structure</h2>
			<p>
				Presently, the structure is super simple. All of the public-facing (plus a few private) functions are in the header files you
				would normally expect them in (e.g. write() is in stdio.h). These reside in an include directory while their respective source
				files reside in the main directory. Currently, the only methods that are spun-out from the standard ones are the functions that
				test the memory management routines. These are in memory.h and are prefixed to avoid conflict.
			</p>
			<h2>Dependencies<h2>
				<h3>Build time</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>GCC. Currently, stdarg.h depends on this since it needs compiler help on AMD64</li>
						<li>Make. Any old make will do.</li>
						<li>GNU autoconf</li>
						<li>GNU automake</li>
						<li>GNU Libtool</li>
						<li>Dejagnu (for tests)</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Run time</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>x86-64 Linux</li>
					</ul>
			<h2>Naming</h2>
			<p>
				Project Paxico is named after the small town of Paxico, Kansas. I drive by it every once in a while on the Interstate and think it's a
				cool name.
